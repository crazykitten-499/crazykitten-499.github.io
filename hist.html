      <h2>About Animation</h2>
      <p>This section is about the history of computer-based animation.</p>

				<h2> Beginning of Computer Animating</h2>
				<p>This type of animation started in the 1940s-50s, when computer graphics experimentation began. A notable example would be John Whitney, an American animator, composer and inventor, considered to be one of the fathers of computer animation.</p>

				<h2> Going 3D</h2>
				<p>3-dimensional graphics became more common by the 1980s, as computer power increased and 3D graphics began to appear in movies. By the 1990s, they had become practical for full films to be animated, such as the famous Toy Story Pixar films.</p>

				<h2> Modern Day Computer Animating</h2>
				<p>Nowadays animation is far more sophisticated, and entire movies can be much higher quality and extremely realistically animated. They are far easier to make, and many people have animation as a hobby, including me. Computer power has improved to a great degree.</p>
